## How To Solve Coding Problems

If you haven't already, clone this repository to your computer:

```nohighlight
$ git clone https://github.com/LaunchCodeEducation/problem-solving-practice.git
```

If you'd like to be able to push your code to your own GitHub repository, fork the repository first, and then clone your fork.

Then, dig in:

1. Code the solutions locally, on your computer, using your code editor.
1. You may solve multiple problems in the same file, but be sure to define a function for each specific problem.
1. When you've solved a problem, commit! If you have your own fork, push the changes to GitHub.

Refer to the [Git Cheatsheet](https://github.com/LaunchCodeEducation/cheatsheets/blob/master/git-basics/README.md) for reference.
