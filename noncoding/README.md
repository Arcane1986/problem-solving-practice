## Fox, Chicken, and the Corn

A farmer is on his way to market with a fox, a chicken, and a bag of corn. He must cross a river to get there. On the bank of the river is a boat that is big enough only for the farmer and one additional item, so he must take the three across one at a time.

- If the farmer takes the fox first, the chicken will eat the corn.
- If the farmer takes the corn first, the fox will eat the chicken.
- If the farmer takes the chicken first, the fox _will not_ eat the corn. However, he'll then have to take either the fox or corn on the next trip, and when left alone to return for the final item one of the first two situations will occur.

How can the farmer get all three across without losing one?

## Apples and Oranges

You have three boxes that contain some combination of apples and oranges:

- One has only apples
- One has only oranges
- One has both apples and oranges

The boxes have lables signifying each of the three, but _each box is mislabled_.

You may ask for one item from one of the boxes to be shown to you. This item will be randomly pulled from the box.

How can you figure out the correct labeling of the boxes?

## Defective Balls

You have a job in the quality control department at a ball factory. A coworker left behind 10 boxes of balls. You know that each normal ball weighs 10g, and each defective ball weighs 9g. There are nine boxes consisting of only normal balls, and one box of only defective balls.

You have a digital scale and can take only one measurement. How can you determine which box contains the defective balls?
