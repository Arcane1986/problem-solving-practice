# Principles of Problem Solving

## Introduction

Problem solving is a skill that gets better with practice. Each problem is different, and will challenge your brain in new ways. While there are approaches and analysis techniques you can use, each problem will have elements that make it unique.

A good analogy for a good problem solver is Sherlock Holmes. Sherlock solves problems by combining analysis with intuition built up over time. To the outsider, Sherlock's skills of deduction seem super-human--and in the world of fiction, they sometimes are--but there is always a logic behind his deductions.

Let's turn you into a Sherlock, but for coding!

## Principles

Here are a few principles to keep in mind when solving problems. Some apply to every situation, some only to specific situations.

View these as tools and approaches to use when you get stuck. If you can solve a problem without explicitely employing any of these principles, then that's great. But if you get stuck, come back to these in order to find some direction forward.

### Don't panic!

This is the first, second, third, and last principle of problem solving. It's a big one. When we're given a problem a common and natural reaction is for a sense of anxiety to creap up. 

_What if I can't figure this out?_

_I'm not smart enough to figure this out!_

_Somebody else in class is going to figure this out before me, because I'm not as smart._

_If I can't do this, my teacher/TA/classmates will know that I don't really understand things!_

We've all thought these things, explicitly or implicitly, at some point. We refere to these types of thoughts as our **demons of doubt**. We carry them around with us, and occasionally they become louder and need to be squashed. 

Panicing, or letting the demons of doubt poke at us, will _not make solving the problem any easier_. Panicing will make solving the problem much harder, and maybe impossible. Mental energy will be expended in a negative direction, distracting from the problem at hand, and preventing full mental clarity.

You will sometimes feel anxiety creep in when starting a new problem. This is natural. But when this happens, acknowledge it and put it aside. Squash those demons of doubt!

### Restate the problem

When you a problem is presented to you in writing, or verbally, restating the problem ensures that you understand precisely what you're being asked to do. 

Here are a few ways to do this:

1. Restate the problem to yourself, in your head or outloud, without looking at the problem statement.
1. Write the problem down on paper, in your own words, without looking at the problem statement.
1. Restate the problem to classmate, coworker, friend, or teacher. Again, do this without looking at the problem statement.

These three restatement strategies are not equal. In fact, this list is order of increasing effectiveness. Restating a problem to yourself in your head is useful, but leaves plenty of opportunity for some of the details of the problem to go undiscovered. Something can sound nice and clear to us, only to later seem to become more complicated. In such situations, it's usually _not_ the case that the complexity of the situation has increased, but just that we've uncovered some previously unnoticed comlexity.

On the other hand, by stating the problem out loud to another person, your brain will be forced to work through it in new ways. There's a maxim that teachers refer to sometimes:

> You don't really understand something until you can teach it to somebody else.

While this idea will definition apply to our final problem solution--we won't _really_ understand our solution unless we can clearly communicated it to somebody else--it also applies to the problem statement itself.

If there isn't somebody nearby to restate the problem to, restating the problem in writing can be more effective than simply restating in your own head. Forcing the problem out of your brain, through your fingers, and onto the page (or computer screen) will cause neurons to fire in new ways. 

This step is crucial. If you can't clearly restate the problem, then you _should not begin trying to solve it_. Doing so would be like trying to drive somewhere without knowing the destination. You might end up at your destination by sheer luck, but even if you do, would you know for sure you were at the right place? We'll rarely be in a situation where we're presented with a clearly-marked map, but we must at least start out with a clear idea of where we want to end up.

### Outline the problem

Once you understand the situation at hand, or the desired outcome, you need to understand the elements at play. At this point, the approach you use will depend on the dynamics of the problem, but here are some strategies for outlining the problem in a bit more detail.

**Write down what you know.** Given the problem statement, what facts do you have at-hand? Are there any basic inferences that you can make from the given facts? 

**Subdivide the problem.** Are there any subtasks or subproblems that will need to be carried out or solved in order to reach the final solution? Write these down. This shouldn't be an exhaustive list of every step, or every line of code, but it should contain a level of detail beyond the problem statement itself.

Examining the problem at this additional level of detail will often expose specific areas that will be of particular challenge. Sometimes, you'll even find one or more pieces that you don't fully understand. This is a chance to reaffirm those pieces before diving into the problem details.

### Reduce the problem

When it's not clear how to approach a problem, make the problem smaller. This will give you a stepping stone on the path to the final solution. Solving a smaller problem can often reveal an approach that can be generalized to the larger problem.

Here are a couple of examples:

---

**Problem:** Write a function that takes a list of integers, and returns the largest integer in the list.

**Reduced Problem:** Write a function that takes a list with exactly two integers, and returns the larger of the two.

---

**Problem:** Write a program that makes an image darker.

**Reduced Problem 1:** Write a program that makes a pixel-by-pixel copy of an image

**Reduced Problem 2:** Write a program that makes a single pixel darker.

### Look for similarities

Have you solved a problem that has some similarities to the one at-hand? If so, go back and review that solution. Think about how the problems are similar, and how they are different. This will help you identify exactly where you might need to focus your energy. 

### Don't panic!

It's worth saying again. For a difficult problem, you'll need all of your mental energy to work out a solution, and anxiety doesn't help us arrive at a solution.

When this feeling starts to creep in, come back to these principles to achieve some direction.
